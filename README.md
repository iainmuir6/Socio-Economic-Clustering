# Socio-Economic Clustering

Repoistory for DS3001 (Practice of Data Science) Final Project 

## Purpose
To answer a data driven question by deploying the data science lifecycle. At the end of the process, you will have an appreciation for what it is like to develop your own questions, match these questions with data, test the ability of the data via a model to answer your question, develop a final solution and the articulation of the weakness and benefits of the approach. The goal is for you to pull all the skills together that we have worked on all semester, essentially living the life of a practicing data scientist!

## Description
